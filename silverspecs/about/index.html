        <h3>OPTOMETRISTS:</h3>
        <p class="pb-3">Optometrists are health care providers who examine, assess, and manage conditions and disorders of the human visual system (the eye). They prescribe treatments for corrective errors including glasses and contact lenses.</p>

        <h3>WHY ARE VISITS IMPORTANT?:</h3>
        <p class="pb-3">While most people know about Optometrists and the diagnosis prescribing correction for visual errors using glasses and contact lenses, few know of the wide scope of diseases and conditions both ocular and systemic (body wide) an Optometrist looks for during an eye exam. From amblyopia, glaucoma, and macular degeneration to diabetes, hypertension, and many more.</p>
        <p class="pb-3">The unique view into the body through the eye makes the Optometrist a vital link in your health. So if you are due (or past due) for an annual eye exam, contact us today for an annual eye exam.</p>

        <h3>YOUR FIRST EYE EXAM:</h3>
        <p class="pb-3">After booking in with us, we will send you a short questionnaire you can fill out from the comfort of your own home and device to collect information and past medical and eye history to help focus and tailor the exam to you.</p>
        <p class="pb-3">When you arrive to the clinic our exam day, our friendly staff will collect any information and insurance you may have and begin pretesting with our automated instruments.</p>
        <p class="pb-3">Your doctor will then call you into the exam room where he will review the questionnaire, pre-test information and proceed with the eye exam.</p>
        <p class="pb-3">At the conclusion of the exam you should expect a prescription, a follow-up schedule, and a smile.</p>
