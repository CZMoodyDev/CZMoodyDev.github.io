                <h3 class="card-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
                <hr>
                <h5>Will the exam hurt?</h5>
                <p>Our procedures are non-invasive and will cause minimal to no pain. Some patients may notice a mild stinging with eye drops, but will only feel the sting for 5-10 seconds.</p>
                <h5>What is dilation?</h5>
                <p>Dilation uses eye drops to cause the pupils (the coloured parts of the eye) to become larger allowing more light into the eye. This allow the doctors to have a better view to the back of the eye. Your doctor will suggest whether or not you will need to dilate on that visit and explain to you what to expect and how long it will take to recover.</p>
                <h5>How long will the exam take?</h5>
                <p>Generally, an eye exam will take between 15-20 or more minutes depending on the reason for visit. Please allow for 30-45 minutes including check in and check out.</p>
                <h5>What happens to the information you collect?</h5>
                <p>Your privacy is important to us. All information is protected in secured and password protected facilities and kept for a minimum of 10 years. Data is backed up onto secure drives in case of computer failures.</p>
                <h5>Do you use the eye-puff machine?</h5>
                <p>Yes, as a screening instrument, we use the eye-puff machine (non-contact tonometer) to measure the pressure of the eyes. This is important for conditions including glaucoma. If requested, we can use other methods of measurement for your comfort.</p>
                <h5>What is an OCT?</h5>
                <p>OCT stands for Optical Coherence Tomographer. Our unit, the 3D Maestro 1 by Topcon, also has retinal photography built in. What all those words mean is that we are able to take high resolution cross section scans of the retina to allow for early detection and monitoring of many diseases including glaucoma, macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and other conditions that may affect your eye health.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>We are committed to providing you with the most accurate prescription possible. However, we recognize that eyes, like the rest of the body, are dynamic structures and prescriptions can change from time to time. We guarantee your prescriptions accuracy for 90 days after your initial visit. If you are not completely satisfied with your vision, we will be happy to recheck your prescription at no extra charge. Any rechecks or visits after the 90 days may be charged the usual and customary fees. As our clinic does not produce lenses or fill prescriptions, please check with the optical you choose for their policy on remakes.</p>
