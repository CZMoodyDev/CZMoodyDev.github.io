    <p>Blue Bronna Wilderness Camp is an interdenominational Christian camp nestled in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta. The camps exist to evangelize and disciple all people through the Gospel of Jesus Christ in a wilderness setting. The camp operates out of two properties - a resident site and a wilderness site.</p>
    <h3 class="bb-gray font-weight-bold">Experience Needed</h3>
    <p>We welcome applications from people with no previous camping or horse experience as well as from seasoned staff. It is your commitment to Christ, your desire to share His love, and you ability (with our training) to teach various activities that are most important. We do need people not afraid of the dark, the cold, long days, hard work, pitching in wherever you are needed, and willingness to grow and learn.</p>
    <h3 class="bb-gray font-weight-bold">Who May Apply?</h3>
    <p>Applications are accepted from those 16 (Junior Staff) and older who know and love Jesus Christ as their Saviour and Lord, relate well to youth, and have a desire to be involved in a ministry. All positions except Junior Staff programs require people to be 18 years old or have graduated from high school by camp time.</p>
