    <p>Our passionate donors will enjoy the opportunity to be a part of the lives of our horses – without the significant demands that horse ownership requires. Having the potential for multiple loving sponsors per horse ensures that each of our horses are cared for equally, as the funds go into an account to support our whole herd. Blue Bronna is a CRA Registered Charity, and we give you a tax receipt for each contribution you make.</p>
    <p>Help us to cover feed, treats, farriers, de-worming, and medical bills, without actually owning a horse! Like other sponsors, you will have access to your horse on specified days throughout the year. This could include just a visit, a good brushing, or a ride!</p>
    <p>Fund a Larger Purchase! – You share our dream: a world where no horse is left behind. Why not live out that dream with us? Your one-time support makes a big difference for expenses such as the winter hay supply, a medical or dental treatment, or new equipment.</p>
    <p>Thank You! – Blue Bronna’s horse family gives campers the chance to grow and face whatever life brings them through the year! Do you have a passion for giving children, teens, and adults experiences that will help them become the best version of themselves? We are so grateful for the changes your monthly contributions spark for our campers, staff and horses in every way, so that’s why we keep you updated on the impact of your prayers!</p>

I remember the days when I was the boss around here, but now I’m more of a middle-of-the-pack kind of gal. Oats still make these old bones sing, though. Although I am sturdy and sound, I lose weight during the summer and need a grain supplement. My old is back starting to sway, and I do so appreciate a couple of nice, sturdy saddle pads between me and a youngster’s saddle.</p>
