        <p>At Blue Bronna we fully depend on God's provision to meet our operational budget. We do not have denominational or corporate support. Camper fees cover about one third of the cost to run a camp, therefore, we rely on donations to cover the shortfall. A large majority of these donations are received through our two main fundraising events: ride-a-thon in September, and Blue Rendezvous in January. We are so thankful for the continuous and generous support we receive year after year at these events. This ministry could not continue to thrive without your support.</p>
        <p>Blue Bronna is looking for monthly partners to help us meet our fixed costs. These costs consist of operational and salary costs. Our goal is to raise $10, 000 in monthly reoccurring donations. While this appears like a large number, every little bit helps. We ask you to prayerfully consider your vital partnership with us through a regular monthly donation. Our goal of $10,000 can be met by donating using the following options:</p>
