        <p>Blue Bronna Wilderness Camp exists to share Christ In A Wilderness Setting.</p>

        <p>Your donation will help us to accomplish this as we support families as they seek to grow together as a family and with God. Blue Bronna is in a unique situation where we have no cell nor internet service and therefore families can focus on each other as they canoe, ride horses, sit around a campfire or go for a walk. We are so thankful for the continuous and generous support we receive from people such as yourself. This ministry could not continue to thrive without your support.</p>

        <p>Blue Bronna is looking for monthly partners to help us meet our fixed costs. These costs consist of operational and salary costs. Our goal is to raise $10, 000 in monthly recurring donations. While this appears like a large number, every little bit helps. We ask you to prayerfully consider your vital partnership with us through a regular monthly donation.</p>

            <strong class="red">NOTICE TO OUR DONORS ABOUT OUR ONLINE DONATION PLATFORM SIMPLYK</strong>

            <p>Unlike other platforms, Simplyk does not charge transaction fees, so your entire donation goes directly to Blue Bronna Wilderness Camp. However, the platform does give you the option to add a voluntary contribution to help Simplyk keep running its services. <strong>If you don’t want to participate, choose Other in the drop-down menu and then enter $0.</strong></p>
            <p>Please fill in the form below. Remember to select whether you want to donate once or donate monthly.</p>
            <p>Your Tax Receipt will be emailed to you in a matter of minutes once you make your donation. <strong>Be sure to check your inbox as well as your Junk Mail box for your receipt the first time that you donate.</strong></p>
