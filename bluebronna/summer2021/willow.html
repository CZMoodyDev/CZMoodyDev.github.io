            <h3 class="font-weight-bold bb-gray">Accommodations</h3>
            <p>Rent a cabin or bring your own trailer. The cabins have 5 bunk beds and either a
                double bed or two single beds. They have lights and heat but no washroom
                facilities. There is a washhouse in the main building which has full bathrooms
                and showers.</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold bb-gray">Food Services</h3>
            <p>Cook your own food at your trailer, over a fire, use our food services or a combo
                of both.</p>
            <p>If you use our Food Services, you are served your food in our kitchen and then
                you eat outside as a family at a large round table under a tarped area.</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold bb-gray">Arrivals and Departures</h3>
            <p>Arrival time is at 4:00pm or later on your first day.</p>
            <p>Departure time is by 2:00pm on your last day.</p>

            <h3 class="font-weight-bold bb-gray">COVID Procedures</h3>
            <p>All campers are to fill out a medical form before they come that has questions
                related to COVID and if they do not meet all the requirements, they are asked to
                contact the camp to rebook at a future date.</p>
            <p>All campers are to sanitize their hands as soon as they come onto the site.</p>
            <p>Sanitize stations are located at the Cook house, the Barn, the chapel area and
                the washrooms.</p>
            <p>Families eat at separate tables outside. They will have a couple of camp staff
                members as their hosts that will sit with them.</p>
            <p>We schedule one family per activity unless there is enough wide-open space to
                have two families at that activity – horseback riding, canoeing and hiking.</p>
            <p>We have enough chapel benches for each family to sit by themselves.</p>
            <p>One family is allowed into the bathrooms as a time.</p>
            <p>No masks are required.</p>
