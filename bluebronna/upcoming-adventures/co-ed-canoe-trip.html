            <h5>The Adventure of a Life-time</h5>
            <h6>Ages 14-17</h6>
            <p>Group size: 10 campers, 5 adults</p>

            <p>This summer we will be offering teens a unique out-tripping adventure in northern Saskatchewan.</p>

            <p>The goal is to offer a camp that stretches the whole person — physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.</p>

            <p>In a program led by trained, experienced Christian leaders, God is presented as a personal God whose plan and purpose for all races, ages and cultures is given in the Bible and demonstrated by His Son, Jesus Christ.</p>

            <p>Activities may include backpacking, flat and moving water skills, white-water paddling, rock climbing and rappel, survival training , outdoor cooking , fishing, swimming, orienteering/ map and compass, gps skills etc. and lots of other great activities, all done in some of the best country God has made plus all the fun of paddling and portaging.</p>

            <p>Starting at Pinehouse Lake, 6 hours north of Saskatoon and going to Besnard Lake.</p>

            <p><b>Cost:</b> $450</p>

            <p>14 day trip – July 3-17</p>
