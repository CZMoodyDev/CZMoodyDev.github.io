    <p>The bond between mothers and their daughters is special, and Blue Bronna is the perfect setting to strengthen that relationship.</p>
    <p>You laugh. You play. You connect. You create memories only you can share.</p>
    <p>The Mother & Daughter Horse Camp offers quality time for both to grow, all while doing crafts, horseback riding, hiking, sitting around a campfire and listening to an inspirational Christian speaker together.</p>
    <p>Take a break from the busyness of everyday life and getaway to the mountains. Leave the meal prep to us while you relax and play. Build lasting memories together during our day trips.</p>
    <p>Expect to participate in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="bulletless"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Riding Horses Everyday - of course!</li>
        <li class="bulletless"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Chop Wood</li>
        <li class="bulletless"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Camp Chores - washing dishes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each day (weather permitting) you will ride through the mountains and enjoy stunning views together. If you are eager you may also get a hike in! You will sing and enjoy evening campfire sessions encountering God. Did we mention how good food tastes cooked in cast iron over an open fire? This will be a trip you and your daughters won’t forget.</p>
    <p>Any combination of women and girls are welcome; it’s not just for mothers and daughters. Daughters bring your mom, grandmother, or aunt and spend some quality time together!</p>
    <p>All meals, snacks, and accommodations are included in the camp fee. The food sure tastes great cooked in cast iron over an open fire.</p>
