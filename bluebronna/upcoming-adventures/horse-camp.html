            <h3>Ages 13 to 17</h3>
            <p><strong>Dates: </strong>June 30th to July 5th, 2024 | Ages 13 to 15</p>
            <p><strong>Dates: </strong>June 14th to July 19th, 2024 | Ages 15 to 17</p>

            <p>8 Participants and 3 Staff</p>

            <p>Your daughter can come to camp and sharpen her horsemanship skills! Our three instructors will
                match their teaching with your child’s level of expertise. They will explore different areas of
                horsemanship including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="bulletless"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Western</li>
                <li class="bulletless"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Bareback</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Bring your own horse or use ours. This clinic style camp is great if your child wants to do nothing but
                horse related activities. This camp is focused both on arena riding and trail rides through the foothills.
                Let us show your youth how her relationship with their horse reflects a relationship with Jesus. She
                will enjoy great food, great company, great teaching and fun evening campfire singing/worship and
                biblical teaching times.</p>
            <p>This camp is located at our Willow Creek site where your daughter will stay in a cabin or a wall tent.
                This site has all the amenities that they could need including indoor plumbing at our washhouse,
                showers and covered eating and campfire areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Start Time: </strong> 4pm Sunday</p>
            <p><strong>End Time: </strong> 2pm on the last day of camp</p>
            <p><strong>Cost: </strong> $550</p>
