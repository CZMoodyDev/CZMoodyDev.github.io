    <p>Blue Bronna is all about creating an environment where dads and sons spend time together and are encouraged in their relationship with each other and with God.</p>
    <p>This is a great opportunity to re-connect or connect deeper with your son and spend time “Away from the Noise” to focus on the important things in life.  Join us and invest in a fun weekend, and receive an abundant return on that investment.</p>
    <p>However. Before you race to grab your hiking gear. Keep in mind this is not deluxe housing…it’s rustic, but you and your son will love it. <!-- This camp is located at our Coat Creek site on the edge of the Livingstone river. -->This camp is located at our Willow Creek site. This remote site has enough amenities to be comfortable, however, we leave the luxuries behind. Campers sleep in canvas tents with a wood stove for heat and most of the food is cooked over the fire. We’ll provide the nutrients, nesting place and neutron-packed program for a weekend you won’t forget.</p>
    <p>You can expect to participate in activities such as: </p>
    <ul>
