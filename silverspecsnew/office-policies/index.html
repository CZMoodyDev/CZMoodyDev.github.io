        <p>We are committed to providing you with the most accurate prescription possible. However, we recognize that eyes, like the rest of the body, are dynamic structures and prescriptions can change from time to time. We guarantee your prescriptions accuracy for 60 days after your initial visit. If you are not completely satisfied with your vision, we will be happy to recheck your prescription at no extra charge. Any rechecks or visits after the 60 days may be charged the usual and customary fees.</p>
        <p>Glasses are unique to you. We want to make sure you're 100% satisfied with your frame purchase. Whether it's the style, fit, or budget that needs to change, you can rest assured that you have 30 days to make sure you got it right.</p>

        <p>Life happens, and sometimes we need to cancel or move our appointments. Just call, email, or message us as soon as possible so we can reschedule your appointment. Whether you are able to contact us 24 hours in advanced, or just 24 minutes - we are happy to help</p>

        <h3>NO SHOW POLICY</h3>
        <p>We do our best to fill our appointments so we can care for others in a timely manner. If you are unable to make it to your appointment, please give us a call so we can cancel your appointment for another patient. Not showing to your appointment can result in a suspension of service.</p>

        <h1 class="pb-3">COVID 19 SAFETY</h1>
        <h4 class="pb-3">Your Safety is Our Priority</h4>

        <p class="pb-3">We are in different times. In response to the coronavirus, we have added procedures to your visit to ensure your safety, and the safety of our staff. Please review the procedures below and, as always, feel free to ask us any questions:</p>

        <p class="pb-3">​Prior to arrival, we ask you to call our number, (403)381-1198, or text us at (587)813-5511 to confirm that you have arrived at our door.​</p>

        <p class="pb-3">When you enter our office, we will ask you to clean your hands with hand sanitizer and to wear a mask while you are in the clinic. If you don’t have a mask, let us know, we can provide you with a disposable mask for your visit.</p>

        <p class="pb-3">We are limiting the amount of objects that are passed between our patients and our staff. Please fill out our intake form on your own personal device, if you are unable to do this please let our staff know.</p>

        <p class="pb-3">If you have insurance we will ask you for your policy numbers and other information at the time of your visit. We have implemented the use of new instruments to limit the time you and the optometrist are in close proximity. Some additional charges may apply to your eye exam including eye exams covered by Alberta Health Care - we will let you know if there is an additional charge to your visit.</p>

        <p class="pb-3">​We have reserved the early morning eye exams (9:30 am - 11:00 am) for those in at-risk groups including seniors (65+) and those with certain pre-existing conditions.</p>

        <p class="pb-3">We have enhanced our cleaning procedures between patients.</p>

        <p class="pb-3">We are limiting the amount of patients we have in our clinic at one time, including families. Please ask our staff for more details.</p>

        <p class="pb-3">Thank you for your cooperation through these trying times. We look forward to helping your eye care needs.</p>

        <p class="pb-3">Stay safe.</p>

        <p class="pb-3">The team at Silver Specs Eye Care + Optical</p>
